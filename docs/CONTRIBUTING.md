**Contributing Guidelines:**

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Project:** Before contributing, take some time to understand the project's goals, structure, and existing codebase.

2. **Check Existing Issues:** Browse through existing issues to see if the problem you encountered or the feature you want to add has already been reported or requested. If not, feel free to create a new issue.

3. **Branching Strategy:** Create a new branch for each significant change or feature you're working on. Use descriptive branch names that reflect the purpose of your changes.

4. **Coding Standards:** Follow the coding style and conventions established in the project. Consistency is key to maintain readability and coherence across the codebase.

5. **Commit Messages:** Write clear and descriptive commit messages that summarize the changes made in each commit. Use present tense and imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

6. **Testing:** If applicable, write tests for your code changes to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce regressions. Run existing tests before committing your changes to avoid breaking existing functionality.

7. **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation, including README files, when making significant changes or adding new features. Clear and up-to-date documentation helps other contributors and users understand the project better.

8. **Pull Requests:** When you're ready to submit your changes, open a pull request (PR) against the main branch. Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the problem it solves or the feature it adds. Mention any related issues for better context.

9. **Review Process:** Be open to feedback and participate in the review process. Address any feedback or requested changes promptly and courteously.

10. **Be Respectful:** Respect the opinions and contributions of other contributors. Be constructive in your feedback and discussions, and strive to create a positive and inclusive environment for collaboration.
